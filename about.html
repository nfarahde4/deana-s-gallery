      <h2>MY WORK</h2>
      <p>I discovered my love for art at a very young age, and it has remained an inseparable part of my life. As a child, I found endless joy in sketching, using pencils and paper to bring my imagination to life. Art became my way of expressing emotions I couldn’t put into words, growing over time into a safe space and source of comfort.</p>
		  
	  <p>Like many artists, my journey hasn’t been easy. School responsibilities and family struggles often pulled me away from creating, and there were times I questioned my passion. Yet, art always found a way to call me back. Every return brought me peace and reminded me why I fell in love with it.</p>
		  
	  <p>In recent years, I’ve explored digital art, starting with Paint, then Medibang, and later IbisPaint X. This opened new creative possibilities and helped me refine my style. Today, art is my therapy, motivation, and the heart of my dreams.</p>

      <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Farah Deana. I’ve always been drawn to the kind of art that tells a story, whether it’s through web design or illustration. Most of my ideas come from everyday things—comics, shows, even a scroll through social media—and they usually start with a mood board or some messy sketches. I like working with color, layering visuals, and finding ways to make something feel alive without overthinking it. My process is pretty flexible. I explore, experiment, and see where things go. For me, it’s more about the journey than perfection—just making something that feels like it has a voice.</p>
